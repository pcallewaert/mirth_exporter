# Mirth Exporter

Export [Mirth Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirth_Connect) channel
statistics to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).

Metrics are retreived using the Mirth Connect CLI. This has only been tested
with Mirth Connect 3.3.2 & Mirth Connect 3.5.1, but it should work with any 3.x version. 

To run it:

    go build
    ./mirth_exporter [flags]
